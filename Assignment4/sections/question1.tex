\section{Question 1}

    The following are the assumptions used in this assignment:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item No offsets
        \item Within a multi-rate chain, the priority of any task is not higher than the priority of its
        predecessor task within the same node
        \item Receving tasks use polling policy to receive messages from the network
        \item Receiving tasks “just miss” the read access of the messages
    \end{itemize}
