\section{Question 3}

    Yes, there is an infeasible path. The infeasible path is $A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\rightarrow D\rightarrow F\rightarrow G\rightarrow H\rightarrow I$. This path is infeasible because if the statement $a[i] > 0$ on line D is false, the statement $a[i] > 2$ can not be true. Therefore line F and line H can not be executed in the same iteration.
