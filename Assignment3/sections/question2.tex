\section{Question 2}

    The loop will continue as long as $i<100$, the intitial value of $i = 0$ and at the end of each iteration $i$ will be increased by $2$. So shortly calculated the loop will be run for $\frac{100}{2} = 50$ times. However, this is not really correct. At the end of the iteration where $i$ will go from $98$ to $100$ the loop will still run one more time since the while statement is at the top of the loop and not at the bottom. The statement will then be tested again and count as one more iteration. So, conclusively, the loop will run for $51$ times.
